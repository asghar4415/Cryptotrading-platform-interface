# Cryptotrading-platform-interface
This Repo is for a university project of Object Oriented Programming Course OOP based on C++ Language to illustrate concepts taught throughout the course.

we tried to include API in this project for real time crypto market data but we couldn't resolve the bugs. So, we made a cryptos.txt file to take the hardcoded market-value of crypto coins.
